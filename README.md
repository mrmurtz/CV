I'm an inquisitive and insight driven UX designer and junior web developer. After a number of years working as a UX designer curiosity about the code behind the design got the better of me, leading me to join Europe's top web development bootcamp at [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com, "Makers Academy").

I've worked in startups as well as corporate environments, co-founded the social enterprise [casseroleclub.com](https://www.casseroleclub.com "Casserole Club") and am actively engaged in tech diversity work through starting [Muslamic Makers](https://medium.com/@murtz_abidi/why-we-re-starting-muslamicmakers-e2f204ce4632#.7hf7ei7qu).

My experience has allowed me to understand the link between people and the products and services they use and how to craft experiences which address business and user needs. I'm looking for opportunities where I can put my coding skills to use alongside my UX experience.

## Skills
